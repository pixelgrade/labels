# labels
Pixelgrade labels list

We use the [git-labelmaker](https://github.com/himynameisdave/git-labelmaker) tool to manage the labels of a repo. Use the `labels.json` as a starting point (add it in a repo in the `.labels` directory) and use the _Add labels from package_ option in git-labelmaker.
